This directory contains the complete documentation for Project Manthan, an AI-native operating system designed to transform India's Media & Entertainment industry through a unified "Concept-to-Contract" platform.

## üìã Documents Overview

### üìä Strategic Blueprint (`strategic-blueprint.md`)
**The Definitive Strategic Foundation**

Comprehensive strategic analysis covering:
- **Market Validation**: Quantified pain points in Indian creator economy (90% earn <‚Çπ18k/month)
- **Product Vision**: Dual-flywheel architecture (Creator Suite + Marketplace Intelligence)
- **Competitive Analysis**: Defensible moats through data flywheel and hyper-verticalization
- **Monetization Strategy**: Hybrid SaaS + Marketplace + DaaS model
- **Go-to-Market Plan**: 3-phase strategy from community validation to enterprise dominance
- **Legal Framework**: DPDP Act 2023 compliance and copyright strategy

### ‚öôÔ∏è MVP Implementation Blueprint (`mvp-implementation.md`)
**The Technical Implementation Roadmap**

Detailed technical guide covering:
- **Architecture**: Vercel + Supabase + Claude API serverless stack
- **Database Schema**: Complete PostgreSQL schema with RLS policies
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints for creator and founder workflows
- **AI Strategy**: 6-step prompt chain for script-to-pitch transformation
- **Security**: Row-level security and data protection compliance
- **Build Guide**: Cloud-only development using GitHub Codespaces
- **Production Prompts**: Copy-paste prompts for Claude Code implementation

## üéØ MVP Strategy: "Managed Marketplace"

**Focus**: Accelerated path for established creators with existing scripts
**Model**: Human-in-the-loop service to solve marketplace cold-start problem
**Goal**: Close 3-5 deals with founding cohort of 20-30 creators + 5-10 buyers

### Key Differentiators
1. **Hyper-Verticalization**: Deep focus on Indian M&E industry specifics
2. **Data Flywheel**: Proprietary intelligence from concept-to-contract pipeline
3. **Trust-First**: Creator's Bill of Rights and DPDP compliance
4. **Cultural Intelligence**: India-specific AI training and localization

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

| Component | Technology | Purpose |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| **Frontend** | Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS | Modern web application with server-side rendering |
| **Backend** | Vercel Serverless Functions (Python) | Cost-effective, auto-scaling API endpoints |
| **Database** | Supabase (PostgreSQL) | Managed database with built-in auth and real-time features |
| **Storage** | Supabase Storage | Secure file storage for scripts and generated assets |
| **Authentication** | Supabase Auth | User management with Row-Level Security |
| **AI Engine** | Anthropic Claude 3 Opus | 200K context window for full script processing |
| **Deployment** | Vercel | Automatic deployments with global CDN |
| **Development** | GitHub Codespaces | Cloud-based development environment |

## üìä Database Schema

### Core Tables
- **`profiles`**: User management extending Supabase auth
- **`projects`**: Creator projects with metadata for ML training
- **`script_uploads`**: File metadata for uploaded scripts
- **`generated_assets`**: AI-generated pitch materials
- **`platform_mandates`**: Founder's proprietary market intelligence
- **`deal_pipeline`**: Deal tracking for success prediction training

### Security Model
- **Row-Level Security (RLS)** on all tables
- **Role-based access**: Creator vs Founder permissions
- **Data isolation**: Users can only access their own projects
- **Admin access**: Founder role has full visibility for marketplace management

## ü§ñ AI Packaging Agent

**6-Step Prompt Chain Process:**

1. **Structural Analysis** ‚Üí Parse screenplay format
2. **Core Elements Extraction** ‚Üí Generate logline, synopsis, themes, characters (JSON output)
3. **Character Bible Generation** ‚Üí Detailed character profiles for each main character
4. **Format Adaptation** ‚Üí Platform-specific adaptation using mandate database
5. **Pitch Deck Content** ‚Üí Synthesize professional pitch materials
6. **Document Assembly** ‚Üí Create formatted DOCX/PDF output

**Key Features:**
- **200K token context** for full script processing
- **Cultural intelligence** through India-specific training data
- **Market-driven adaptation** using proprietary platform mandates
- **Human-in-the-loop** review and refinement
